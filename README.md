# THE ARCHETYPE PROJECT


*EDIT 13-08-45*

Estoval has set up a more secure back-end so I have moved all assets for the Archetype Project there. I’m leaving the multi-user lock notes here. Somehow I got it’s project files tangled up in the Archetype’s and I figured this was a good opportunity to clean up.


**Security System Update**

Pitch: The current system employed by MindCore’s internal security is in need of improvement.

The current system requires multiple users to be present (and active) to proceed. Theoretically, this makes breaches impossible to achieve by an individual – an idea that sounds great in writing, but discounts the possibility of persons with basic hacking abilities coordinating an assault.

Each user requires MindCore Admin Access privileges – not something that is difficult to do if you know the command. Yes, 25+ false identities appearing at once is much easier to detect than one, but once they have the role that allows them to run the key-gen sequence, they can get into our systems legitimately, which is IMPOSSIBLE to detect for fraudulence.

The dynamic password generation is a nice touch, but it’s a little campy.

*UPDATE 18-08-45*

Esper reviewed my notes and insisted on keeping the system in place. Apparently clients like being a part of the process.

*UPDATE 19-08-45*

Esper requested I review their prefactored control unit. I’ve improved its identification protocols and overall persistence, though I fear it will do little to improve the overall integrity of the system. Try as you might, you can’t polish a turd.

*UPDATE 24-09-45*

Esper hasn’t spoken about the system since. I guess that’s how things are staying. I can see why Estoval wanted me to pull the Archetype files…
